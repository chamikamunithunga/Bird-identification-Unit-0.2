This project is an advanced version of my bird identification system, integrating TensorFlow for deep learning-based classification and the eBird API for real-time bird species information. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on diverse bird datasets, the system accurately classifies bird species from images.

Additionally, the eBird API enriches the system by fetching detailed information, such as habitat, migration patterns, and population trends, making it not just an identifier but a knowledge hub for bird enthusiasts and researchers. Future improvements include real-time identification, voice-based search, and mobile app integration.
