This project is an advanced version of my bird identification system, integrating TensorFlow for deep learning-based classification and the eBird API for real-time bird species information. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on diverse bird datasets, the system accurately classifies bird species from images.

Additionally, the eBird API enriches the system by fetching detailed information, such as habitat, migration patterns, and population trends, making it not just an identifier but a knowledge hub for bird enthusiasts and researchers. Future improvements include real-time identification, voice-based search, and mobile app integration.


This project bridges AI and birdwatching, offering an intelligent tool for nature lovers and ornithologists!

This is the Output (have some intergration for using Api to fetch more data with identified bird name with more depth of the bird profile)
